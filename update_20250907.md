**[A Natural History of Beauty](https://meltingasphalt.com/a-natural-history-of-beauty/)**

*Published: October 30, 2018*

A mashup of ideas from David Deutsch, Geoffrey Miller, and Richard Prum, with a little César Hidalgo for good measure. Look no further than the debates over whether beauty is “objective” or “subjective. When we can’t agree on this most fundamental distinction, we're not talking about the same thing. I’ve been mulling over the idea of beauty recently, letting the word glide around over many possible meanings. Unlike the other meanings I’ve toyed with, this one is tangible and solid; it keeps its shape.

**[The Elephant in the Brain](https://meltingasphalt.com/the-elephant-in-the-brain/)**

**[Here Be Sermons](https://meltingasphalt.com/here-be-sermons/)**

*Published: September 11, 2017*

I've long turned up my nose at sermons and related forms of mass moralizing. The other reason I've eschewed sermons is that I've never properly understood them. They live in one of those dark, uncharted regions on my map of human social behavior. Until recently, I mistook them for a grandiose form of nagging. "Now children," the preacher says, in a voice dripping with smarm, "be nice to each other. " But this is off-putting: I don't want to be nagged, and I sure as hell don't want to be nagging others.

**[U.S. Intel](https://stratechery.com/2025/u-s-intel/)**

*Published: August 26, 2025*

Now that everyone is using ChatGPT, the lazy columnist’s trick of quoting Wikipedia to open an Article is less cliché than it is charming (at least that’s my excuse). Creating the strongest form of the opponent’s argument may involve removing flawed assumptions that could be easily refuted or developing the strongest points which counter one’s own position. Developing counters to steel man arguments may produce a stronger argument for one’s own position. The beauty of being in the rather lonely position of supporting the U.

**[Paradigm Shifts and the Winner’s Curse](https://stratechery.com/2025/paradigm-shifts-and-the-winners-curse/)**

*Published: August 06, 2025*

It’s fun — and often accurate — to think of tech companies in pairs. Apple and Microsoft defined the PC market; Microsoft and Intel won it. Google and Meta dominate digital advertising; Apple and Google won mobile. That, however, is not the defining pair of the smartphone era, which ran from the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 to the launch of ChatGPT in 2022; rather, the two most important companies of the last two decades of tech were Apple and Amazon, specifically AWS.

**[Content and Community](https://stratechery.com/2025/content-and-community/)**

*Published: July 21, 2025*

Second, I have long thought that what happened to content was a harbinger for what would happen to industries of all types. That meant that if you could understand how the Internet impacted publishing — newspapers, books, magazines, music, movies, etc. — you might have a template for what would happen to other industries as they themselves digitized. Or, if you really want to get crazy, to the evolution of humanity itself. What remains is one final bundle: the creation and substantiation of an idea.

**[Tech Philosophy and AI Opportunity](https://stratechery.com/2025/tech-philosophy-and-ai-opportunity/)**

*Published: July 08, 2025*

One of the most paradoxical aspects of AI is that while it is hailed as the route to abundance, the most important financial outcomes have been about scarcity. This reality meant that the company mattered more than any one person, putting a cap on individual contributor salaries. It’s that last point I’m interested in; I’m not in position to judge the value of any of the players changing teams, but the teams are worth examining. Consider Meta and Apple and the latest free agent signing; from Bloomberg: Apple Inc.

**[part one here](https://idlewords.com/2023/1/why_not_mars.htm)**

*Published: September 07, 2023*

For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for nature cannot be fooled. HiRISE, 2011 The goal of this essay is to persuade you that we shouldnât send human beings to Mars, at least not anytime soon. Landing on Mars with existing technology would be a destructive, wasteful stunt whose only legacy would be to ruin the greatest natural history experiment in the Solar System. It would no more open a new era of spaceflight than a Phoenician sailor crossing the Atlantic in 500 B.

**[urine icicle blocking the Space Shuttle toilet](https://idlewords.com/urine_icicle.htm)**

The tail would be burned off, and the Shuttle would crash: I thought of my life being threatened in many ways, but never by a block of frozen urine. Any rate, so we ended up using the robot arm. âThe heater on the outside of the dump nozzle failed, so this blob of frozen urine froze on the side of the vehicle, and what they were worried about was on reentry this blob of ice would break off, fly back, hit the tail, gouge out the heat tile.

There was a time during the countdown when there was a problem with the inverter in the Redstone. So he called and said, "This inverter is not working in the Redstone. They're going to pull the gantry back in, and we're going to change inverters. It's probably going to take about an hour, an hour-and-a-half. " And I said, "Well, if that's the case then I would like to get out and relieve myself. And I thought my bladder was getting a little full and, if I had some time, I'd like to relieve myself.

## The Dilbert Blog: The Day You Became A Better Writer

*Published: May 08, 2008*

My jaw dropped when I heard that presidential candidate Clinton dismissed the unified opinion of every economist on the planet and supported the gas tax rebate. I think that proves both of them are unqualified to be president. Obama isn’t much better when it comes to sorting out economic policy from pandering, although he did avoid that particular landmine. Starting today, this blog is moving to http://dilbert. The rebate is John McCain’s proposal. All we’ll do is agree to vote for the candidate with the best long term economic policy, according to the consensus of leading economists.

Join 120,000+ getting mindf*cked every Saturday morning while reading about the mind, the internet, and the future. I’ve been baffled by the responses everyone has had to it. 0 that I could use to explore various topics and problems with AI. In the Metatype prompt, I’ve had people respond that it brought them to tears. Earlier this week, I wrote HUMAN 3. 30 hours of obsession later, I realized a vastly underutilized use case for AI, which is managing large swaths of knowledge that you already have.

I wanted to become multidimensionally jacked.

If you aren’t, you either have a method that works for you (this letter won’t apply to you) or you’re wasting your time and should probably be on social media. Join 120,000+ getting mindf*cked every Saturday morning while reading about the mind, the internet, and the future. If you’re a writer, creator, freelancer, or anyone else who is trying to “make it” doing something meaningful, you’re probably on social media. They don’t have an opinion that pushes someone to either change their mind or act.
